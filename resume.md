## Troy Cotton 
Emerging UX Designer | Product Manager | Healthcare Leader 

My transition to UX design is a direct result of years of being open to solving new challenges in the healthcare operations space. I’ve solved financial analysis questions by facilitating workshops and designing diagrams; I’ve advocated for additional resources using visual storytelling techniques; and, I’ve designed communication strategies and workflows to inform and empower healthcare providers. Knowing how to directly apply my creativity to new environments will allow me to continue growing and flourishing as a UX Designer.
